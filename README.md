neetcode.io - An "optimized" list of leetcode questions with video solutions for them all. I was using it a lot at first, but it seems like a lot of frontend interviews don't go too hard on leetcode so I've stopped focusing here for the time being.

frontendinterviewhandbook.com - A pretty good general guide book on things to prepare for

BFE.dev - This is where I've spending most of my time lately, it's help reinforce a lot of JS intricacies I've forgot about.

Codepen.io - Spent some time on here just building small apps with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS

Javascript.info - Great resource on brushing up on JS
