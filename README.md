## Interview training

[Neetcode](neetcode.io) - An "optimized" list of leetcode questions with video solutions for them all. I was using it a lot at first, but it seems like a lot of frontend interviews don't go too hard on leetcode so I've stopped focusing here for the time being.

[FrontEnd Interview Handbook](frontendinterviewhandbook.com) - A pretty good general guide book on things to prepare for

[BFE.dev](BFE.dev) - This is where I've spending most of my time lately, it's help reinforce a lot of JS intricacies I've forgot about.

[Codepen](Codepen.io) - Spent some time on here just building small apps with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS

[JS.info](Javascript.info) - Great resource on brushing up on JS
